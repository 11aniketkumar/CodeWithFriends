## üåü What is "Code With Friends"?

"Code With Friends" is an ambitious python application developed using the tkinter library. The main objective was to create a GUI-based coding platform that fosters collaboration and project management among aspiring developers, seasoned programmers, and tech enthusiasts. While the initial vision was to mimic some functionalities of GitHub, it became evident that the application is best suited for offline use, and thus does not support online collaboration.
