# CodeWithFriends

This project was built by me for my 12th class finals project.

At that time, I was interested in github and how it works, so I decided to create a version control system using python.
This project uses following languages and libraries:-
1. Python
2. SQL
3. tkinter

Looking back, I made many mistakes like not adding any documentation, not dividing the program into multiple modules and not using classes and objects.
I didn't divide program into many files because according to instructions, each student had to submit only one file.
I didn't use classes and objects, because I was not knowing OOP's part of python at that time.
